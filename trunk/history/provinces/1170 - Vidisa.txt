# The problem with Alexander's push was his lack of total conquest of Egypt; the Kemetic part of his army rebelled and went over to the side of the Persians under whom they had been just a few months prior. The Gate of Persia stood as Alexander's army got pushed out of the pass and into the surrounding areas, then routed, from both sides. It was a miracle Alexander got away.

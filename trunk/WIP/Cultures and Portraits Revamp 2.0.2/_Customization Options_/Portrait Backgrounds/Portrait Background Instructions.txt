Portrait Backgrounds
========================

This folder contains customization options for changing the background portraits of different characters in VIET Immersion. It will work with both on-going and new games.

Currently, these options are available:
- Additional Portrait Backgrounds: Additional portrait backgrounds for various situations. May slow down performance a bit.
- Alternate African Background: Use a different potential background for African characters instead of the default

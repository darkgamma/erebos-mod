hema_1_desc;This character knows how to work blood and magic. The arcane arts take years to learn and decades to hone and perfect - it is no wonder that hemalurgy is a rare art. Men privy to the meanings behind the bloodthirsty whispers are reluctant to share them. This makes hemalurgists both extremely dangerous and in high demand. Just remember: he whom the gods love dies young.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ARM.1;The Prelude;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCARM.1;From birth you've been told magic is dangerous, magic is strong. As much as it is a tool stronger than imagination, it is a liability unlike anything else. You've already called your head hemalurgist to you and are awaiting his knock any moment now, but you know you can back out of this any time you want - you haven't even started the process, after all. If you want to stop, the best time for that would be about now as backing away now, as opposed to later, carries no risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
NOTARM.1;Now that I think of this, it might not be such a good idea after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

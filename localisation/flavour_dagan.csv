DAGAN.1.desc;As you go by the edges of the land, you end up walking a path in a fishing village. Even though you usually go with a cohort you're without bodyguards - you know there's no danger here. The beach is full with youth playing sport and children enjoying the water. Some are cooking fish in a clay pot. Their eyes go wide upon seeing you. They beg for you to join them in their modest feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTA.DAGAN.1;"Instead of just us, why not have the whole village feast on fish?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTB.DAGAN.1;"I am feeling somewhat hungry, actually...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTC.DAGAN.1;"Fish. How disgusting.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAGAN.2.desc;It is nigh midnight when a servant comes to your chambers as you prepare to sleep. He apologises profusely as he hands you a silver platelet with a peasant's representations of Dagan and Ba'al etched into it. He claims it has divine properties. It isn't of the highest quality but it could pass. A layer of dry salt covers it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTA.DAGAN.2;Accept the plate and put it by your bedside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
OPTB.DAGAN.2;"Take this to the mint.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x

DAGAN.1.desc;As you go by the edges of the land, you end up walking a path in a fishing village. Even though you usually go with a cohort you're without bodyguards - you know there's no danger here. The beach is full with youth playing sport and children enjoying the water. Some are cooking fish in a clay pot. Their eyes go wide upon seeing you. They beg for you to join them in their modest feast.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
